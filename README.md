# Trend-Seeker-Final-Project

<br />

### About The Project 

In today's era, it is important for business owners to find ways to predict customer behavior,
which is largely influenced by social media. One of the effective means for this is following trends in social media, which influence the purchase of specific products.
In our final project we focus on recipe trends, to better understand the relationship between them and product sales forecasting. This is done by identifying patterns and gaining useful insights for businesses in the food industry. This information can help those business owners optimize their inventory, maximize their profits and adapt to market changes.
