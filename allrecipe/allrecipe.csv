What Are Currants and What Do You Do With Them?",Corey Williams,"
Here’s what you need to know about this small but mighty ingredient.",,,,"
Ever wondered what exactly makes a currant a currant? You've come to the right place.
,
Currants, also called Zante currants or Black Corinth raisins, are dried berries that come from seedless Black Corinth grapes. These are not to be confused with black, red, or white currants, which are grape-like berries that come from shrubs and are not usually eaten dried.
,
A currant is a type of raisin. Raisins are dried grapes. There are plenty of varieties, but in the U.S., ""raisin"" typically refers to dark-colored dried large grape. Currants come from Black Corinth grapes similarly to how golden raisins come from sultana grapes.
,
The word ""currant"" is derived from ""Corinth,"" a Greek city famous for its small, dark grapes.
,
""As early as 75 A.D., Pliny the Elder writes of a tiny Greek grape, thin-skinned, juicy, and sweet, and with bunches exceedingly small,"" according to ,, a manual by the University of California. ""It then dropped out of written history until the eleventh century, when trade of this type of raisin between the Greek producers and the Venetians were recorded.""
,
By the 17th-century, trade shifted toward a group of Greek islands, particularly Zakynthos (Zante). That's why they're sometimes called Zante currants. These days, currants are produced all over the world.
,
Dried currants are tiny, bluish brown and black raisins. Their wrinkles are fine to medium, but quite distinct. Fresh Black Corinth berries are small, round, and reddish black. They're mostly seedless, but particularly large ones may contain a few hard seeds. They grow in small, cylindrical clusters.
,
Currants are quite flavorful. They taste similar to regular raisins, but with a more pronounced sweetness and depth.
,
Though they're small, currants pack a healthy punch. Nutritional highlights include:
,
,: ,
,
Because of their tender skin and small size, currants are often used for cooking and baking. For a sweet treat, we recommend stirring currants into scone dough instead of regular raisins.
,
If you're in the mood for something savory, currants will add a touch of sweetness and texture to your breads, salads, or holiday stuffings. Basically, anything you can do with raisins, you can do with currants.

Lentil Flatbread",Chef John,"
This 3-ingredient, extremely simple recipe is easier than you may think and may just become your new favorite healthy flatbread.","

Lentil Flatbread – Better Red Than Bread
,
As I mention in the intro, I was a little skeptical when I first heard about a vegan, low-carb, high-fiber flatbread that's made with nothing more than lentils and water. Okay, I was a lot skeptical, but after a few minutes of searching, I realized this really was a thing, and sort of looked like one of my all-time favorite foods, the magical dosa. Turns out the taste and texture aren't that similar, but they do have one thing in common. They're both perfect for rolling up, wrapping around, or dipping into other kinds of deliciousness.
,
I kept things very simple here, and didn't season these with anything other than salt. And, if you are going to pair them with the aforementioned ""other kinds of deliciousness,"" then maybe that's all you need. Having said that, there are many obvious choices in the way of herbs and spices that can be included in the batter, and if you like these, which you will, I'm sure that you'll explore those eventually.
,
I did cook some the same day I made the batter, and they were fine, but I do think an overnight rest in the fridge improved the taste and the texture. Besides that, the other big decision is exactly how much water to blend in. Less water means a thicker batter, which means a thicker flatbread, so feel free to experiment with that as well, but for me, 1 part red lentils to 2 parts water seemed to be ideal. No matter how you adjust yours, I really hope you give this easy, nutritious, and very tasty lentil flatbread recipe a try soon. Enjoy!
,
Add lentils and water to a blender, or food processor and soak for at least 3 hours.
,
Blend lentils until they are very smooth. Season with salt. (Batter can be used immediately, but for best results refrigerate overnight).
,
To cook, heat a non-stick pan on medium-high. Grease lightly with olive oil and allow to get hot. Add 1/4 to 1/3 cup of batter to the hot pan. Use the bottom of a ladle or spoon to spread out into a 5 or 6 inch circle. Lower heat to medium, and adjust from there if needed. Cook the first side for about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, before flipping over. Cook the second side for about 2 minutes, before transferring to a plate.
,
Keep warm flatbreads covered with a towel while cooking and stacking.
,
These can be made ahead and reheated. Or cooked and then frozen.
,
Use less water for thicker flatbreads. Feel free to season with spices and herbs if you like.
